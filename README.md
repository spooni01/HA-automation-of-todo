# Home Assistent: Automation of To-do`s

In an increasingly digital and automated world, the need for comprehensive solutions to manage everyday household tasks is growing. Manually tracking various responsibilities can be overwhelming and often leads to missed or neglected tasks. This integration aims to enhance Home Assistant by building upon the existing Local To-Do integration, focusing on simplifying and streamlining household task management.

With this integration, users can intuitively create, edit, and delegate tasks, set reminders based on complex criteria, and track the complete history of tasks in an organized interface. Additionally, the integration can autonomously generate new tasks based on data from connected smart devices, making it a powerful tool for efficient home management.

## Setting Up the Integration

If you want to pull this integration, please follow these steps:

1. Initialize a Git repository in the `config/` directory:
